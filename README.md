# 👋 Hi, I’m Michael!
## 👀 I am into programming since school. I have tried different directions. I created my first website at the age of 17 and gradually mastered the basics of programming. I have dealt with Java, C#, GO, but I’m leaning towards JavaScript. Currently looking forward to challenging and interesting projects that will boost my skills!
